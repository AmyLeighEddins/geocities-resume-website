  "John and Amy's story begins in early 2018. John was absentmindedly swiping through Tinder while on his break at work, about ready to give up and delete the app (again), when he came across a familiar face. There she was! That cute girl he was too nervous to approach at the Boris/Thou show back in November of last year! He swiped right and crossed his fingers. Amy was entranced by his goofy pictures and had to swipe right as well. They ended up matching, and quickly bonded over their mutual great tastes in music, and planned on meeting at the upcoming Sleep show at Saturn in a few weeks. Leading up to this date, John had talked excitedly with friends and coworkers, and was delighted to find that there were mutual connections among his existing friends – all of whom vouched for how amazing Amy was. Amy was getting the same feedback about John from those same friends. John and Amy’s first “meeting” was actually arranged this way while on a night out. Upon finding out that the two were going on a date, their mutual friend Andy had Amy meet John after a night of karaoke. The meeting, while brief, went well, and the two cemented their date plans for later that upcoming week.",
  "This first date was on January 21st, 2018. The two played board games with Amy's housemates (Ben and Katie), then saw Yautja, Sleep, and… a mysterious third band. The date went exceptionally well, and a follow-up date was set up soon afterwards. John and Amy officially became a couple on February 9th of that same year. They grew in love over the coming months - enjoying game nights, concerts, movies, and evenings on the beanbag watching TV or anime together. Towards the end of 2018, they decided to take the next step and moved in together. John and Amy, along with her dog, Scout, moved into a house off Montclair Road in December 2018. They quickly acclimated to home life together, and found balance among their household duties.",
  "In June 2019, their household saw a new, unexpected addition: a cat! Their friend, Kati, had rescued a kitten she found in their apartment complex. John and Amy agreed to foster and potentially keep the kitten, provided no owner came forward. After finding that the previous owner did not want him, John and Amy elected to add their new feline friend to the family and named him Radagast (John, in his colorblind state, thought Radagast looked brown…. he's definitely orange). Scout and Radagast made fast friends, though Radagast tends to bully Scout on occasion (they're working on remedying that).",
  "John and Amy's relationship continued to thrive, even through the struggles of global pandemic. Throughout the years, the two have cultivated solid mutual friendships and have continued to grow in their careers and personal lives. In November 2020, the family moved again, this time to a home they owned, rather than rented - a true triumph considering the hectic housing market.",
  "While the two had talked of marriage throughout their time together, John and Amy were patient and wanted to be certain they were right for each other. Over several years together, they made the best of any challenges that came their way, allowing their love to grow. John proposed to Amy on December 22nd 2021. While the proposal was lackluster without much finesse, Amy accepted. Since then, John and Amy have continued to cultivate a fantastic life together with their furry companions.",
